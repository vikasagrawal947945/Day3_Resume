    <h3>Project Leadership: Dealoye Buying and Selling Platform</h3>
    <p>As the project lead, I was responsible for developing the Dealoye Buying and Selling Platform. I led the team
        from start to finish, ensuring the platform was designed and developed using modern web technologies. This
        involved gathering requirements, designing the structure, coding, and deploying the platform. I made sure to
        focus on creating a user-friendly interface and optimizing performance to enhance user experience. The project

    <h3> Full-Stack Development Skills </h3>
    <p>I have experience with both front-end and back-end development, which helped me manage and implement features for
        the Dealoye platform. I worked with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js to build an
        efficient, scalable platform. I ensured the front-end was responsive and visually appealing, while the back-end
        maintained smooth functionality. I also utilized databases and API integration to enhance the platformâ€™s
        capabilities.</p>

    <h3>Open Source Contributions</h3>
    <p>I actively contribute to open-source projects, where I collaborate with global developers to improve code
        quality, fix bugs, and add new features. My contributions have helped me gain a deeper understanding of industry
        best practices and coding standards. Working on open-source projects has also allowed me to improve my
        problem-solving and teamwork skills, which I apply in my own projects.</p>
